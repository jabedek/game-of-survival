# GameOfSurvival
**Project of a game based on 'Game of Life' with some variations and additional features like non-moving units and broods (4-units groups). Currently, this project consists of builder mode and simple simulator.** 

Also you can: 
- toggle unit types (on click), drag units (if moveable),
- spawn unit broods (on right click) 
- watch all sorts of interesting data on a right panel while everything moves**

General focus in this work is on creating algorithms allowing to simulate interesting behaviors and on learning ngrx/store arch and how to optimize UI / browser responsiveness (in process).
